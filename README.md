# GENTA7740-SRC
Non-buildable src of genta7740 4.11 modmenu. Gentas libs are included in readable form (dumped.)
Not a good source, didn't bother making actual readable java code from .smalis, but someone can if they want to.
Even then, likely not buildable. Not sure though, try if ya'll want to.

Someone who cares enough can make this buildable, if its even possible. Smali2java can probably be used to make smalis into java classes.

nuk: decompiling apk, dumping classes
alex: reversing libs, aswell as dumping them from the beginning

reversed libs will not be released, they were used to test making a safer as fast as modmenu gg script alternative against genta's shitbox lmao.
