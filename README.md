# GENTA7740-SRC
Non-buildable src of genta7740 4.11 modmenu. Gentas libs are included in readable form (dumped.)
Not a good source, didn't bother making actual readable java code from .smalis, but someone can if they want to.
Even then, likely not buildable. Not sure though, try if ya'll want to.

Libs dumped by Alex. APK decompiled by nukiz. Someone who cares enough can make this buildable, if its even possible. Smali2java can probably be used to make smalis into java classes.
